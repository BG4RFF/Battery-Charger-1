Basic Installation
==================

To use this, unpack into a directory which by default will be batterycharger-pc.
Also obtain the acquisition-lib package, and unpack it in the same way.
Obtain QextSerialPort from http://qextserialport.sourceforge.net/ and unpack the
tarball into the directory qextserialport. This directory is assumed to be at 
the same directory level as aquisition-pc, you can change this in
avrserialprog.pro. Make sure that you have QT4 installed. Go into the
qextserialport directory and execute:

$ qmake-qt4
$ make clean
$ make

This will build the qextserialport libraries. Copy these across to one of the
library directories or change your library search path to allow the linker to
find them.

Get the acquisition-prog package from these webpages and unpack it into the
same top directory as acquisition-pc and qextserialport. Follow the instructions
in the INSTALL.txt file there to compile it.

Return to the batterycharger-pc directory. The serial port used is preset in the
code. To change this edit the acqunit.h file near the top. Execute:

$ qmake-qt4
$ make clean
$ make

This will build the application. Copy the binary to a suitable place and invoke
with:

$ batterychargercontrol
