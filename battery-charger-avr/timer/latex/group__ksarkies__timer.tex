Interrupt Timer library This library provides basic functions for performing timer operations.  


\begin{Code}\begin{verbatim} #include <timer.h> 
\end{verbatim}
\end{Code}



When interrupts are enabled, the ISR can contain a callback function to allow the user to perform critical actions at the exact time the timer has reached its count. To use this facility, create a file timercallback.h in the same directory, with the function prototypes: void timer0CallBack() void timer1CallBack() void timer2CallBack() defined, according to the number of timers in the MCU. This can then be filled out as desired. The callback feature can be disabled.
