This library aims to provide a range of timer functions for initializing and controlling the opertaion of the timers. It appears to be somewhat difficult to provide a complete set of general functions despite a good compatibility between timers within the Atmel range of AVR processors, because the ISRs are often used in a wide variety of different ways specific to the application. The use of callback functions to the application can result in heavy use of resources.

Currently only timer 0 is supported here with initialization and reading of its value.
