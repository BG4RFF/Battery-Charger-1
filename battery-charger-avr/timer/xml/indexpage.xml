This library aims to provide a range of timer functions for initializing and controlling the opertaion of the timers. It appears to be somewhat difficult to provide a complete set of general functions despite a good compatibility between timers within the Atmel range of AVR processors, because the ISRs are often used in a wide variety of different ways specific to the application. The use of callback functions to the application can result in heavy use of resources.</para><para>Currently only timer 0 is supported here with initialization and reading of its value.</para><para><simplesect kind="note"><para>Software: AVR-GCC 3.4.5 </para><para>Target: All Atmel MCUs with timer functionality </para><para>Tested: ATMega88 at 8MHz. </para></simplesect>
